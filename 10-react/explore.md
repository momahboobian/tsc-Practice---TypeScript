## Task:

npm install
npm run dev

Look through the code and try to understand what pieces are doing.

Pick out any uses of the TS skills that we have talked about.

Notice any that we haven't.

- Do you think TypeScript helps here?
- Do you think TS is too much?
- As a new dev to this project, would you know how to add to it?
- Does TS help or hinder that?
